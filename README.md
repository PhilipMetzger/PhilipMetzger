- Hi, I’m @PhilipMetzger
- I’m interested in [Rust], C++, C, Browsers (Chromium and Webkit), [Buildsystems], [Databases], [gRPC] and [LLVM]. 
- I’m currently learning [Bazel], [Rust] and [Go].
- I previously worked with [SAP],[ABAP], [UIPath], [Sikulix], [Python], [Typescript], [Javascript], [C#] and [Java]. 
- I like a good developer experience and Monorepos.
- In the future, I also want to work with [Kubernetes] and [Envoy].
- I like to work in Infrastructure (Build, Plattform, Toolchain, Release) and enjoy doing DevOps/SRE work.
- Software I look out for: [Jujutsu] and [Eden].
- I have a small [blog].

I like Google's Borg, GFS and Bigtable papers and Buildsystems a la carte.
I'm trying to build a infrastructure on phabricator.
